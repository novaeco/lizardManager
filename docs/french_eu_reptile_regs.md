# Summary of French and EU Regulations for Amateur Reptile Keeping

Keeping reptiles in captivity within France and the European Union is regulated to ensure animal welfare and prevent illegal trade. Below is an overview of key regulations relevant to hobbyists. This summary is not exhaustive, and local requirements may vary.

## French Regulations

* **Environmental Code (Code de l'environnement)** – Sets the general legal framework for wildlife protection and the conditions for keeping non-domestic animals.
* **Arrêté du 8 octobre 2018** – Defines species lists and authorizations required for keeping or breeding non-domestic animals, including many reptiles. Certain species require a certificate of capacity (*certificat de capacité*) and/or an establishment permit (*autorisation d'ouverture*).
* **CITES Implementation** – France implements the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) via national rules. Import, export, and sale of listed species often require permits.

Official resources are available on [Légifrance](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/) and from the French Ministry responsible for ecology.

## EU Regulations

* **Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97** – Governs trade in species of wild fauna and flora within the EU in accordance with CITES. It lists species in different annexes that determine permit requirements for trade and keeping.
* **Directive 2010/63/EU** – Concerns the protection of animals used for scientific purposes and may apply to breeders or institutions conducting research on reptiles.

Additional guidance can be found on the [European Commission Environment page](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/).

## Verify Local Laws

Regulations can differ between EU member states and even between local authorities. Before acquiring or selling any reptile, ensure that you consult the relevant laws and obtain any necessary permits. Failure to comply with local regulations can lead to significant penalties.
