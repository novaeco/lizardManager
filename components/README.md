# Components

This project defines several custom components:

- **dht22** - stub driver for a DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor.
- **ds18b20** - stub driver for a DS18B20 temperature probe.
- **relay** - simple GPIO-controlled relay driver.
- **logger** - saves sensor readings to SPIFFS.
- **ui** - minimal LVGL interface displaying temperature and humidity.
- **settings** - stores configurable temperature and humidity ranges in NVS.
